# About me
Hello stranger.  I started learning rust in early 2021 and have really grown to love the language. If you happen to read through the code and have comments on how I could improve I'd be happy to hear them.

# Goal
I am going to try and complete these the day they come out, but life is a thing so my realistic goal is to square away the week every Sunday.
